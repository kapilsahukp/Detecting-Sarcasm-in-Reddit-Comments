# Detecting-Sarcasm-in-Reddit-Comments
Performing EDA on Reddit comments and building models to predict a sarcastic comment!!
============================================================================================

Using reddit data to detect sarcasm in the comments.
The aim of this project is to detect if the comments in Reddit threads are sarcastic or not?

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the selected dataset to gain interesting insights and answer the following queries:
1. Detecting which sub-reddit has more sarcastic comments?
2. Do sarcastic comments get more upvotes?
3. Does sarcasm come with profanity, as a response to profanity in comments?
4. What are some most frequently used internet slang in a sarcastic comment?
5. Observing/analysing sarcasm trends over time on popular sub-reddits.

How???

By using Neural Networks with models like artificial neural networks, RNNs like LSTMs with the representations/embedding of the words using techniques like TF-IDF and GloVe to predict whether a comment is sarcastic or not.
